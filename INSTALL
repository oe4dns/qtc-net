This is how to install a QTC Net Node, this text is still evolving that means it may not be fully complete. 
Please send Feedbacks to OE1SRC in qtc Net or oe1src at oevsv.at. 


Get the Source: 

$ git clone https://github.com/zem/qtc-net.git 



Install: 

$ make 

# and as root: 
$ make install


You may have to link you /etc/qtc/apache-site.conf manually to your 
apache site directory, the file is a bit complex to avoid login 
access without ssl.
