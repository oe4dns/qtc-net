You may have to link you /etc/qtc/apache-site.conf manually to your 
apache site directory, the file is a bit complex to avoid login 
access without ssl. 

There are three init.d services (qtc-processor, qtc-aprs, qtc-sync-http) which have config files in /etc/qtc/
The default system wide message store is in /var/spool/qtc/messages as user www-data.
