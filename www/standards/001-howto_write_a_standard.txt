Title: How to Write QTC Net Standards
Authors:
	- Hans Freitag <zem@fnordpol.de>
QTC Standard Number: 1
Version: 2014073100
License: GPLv3
Abstract:
	QTC Net only works by a set of standards where each standard defines a solution for 
	one special problem. All those standards together will form the whole QTC Net. Because
	QTC Net is still in Development we will keep and Maintain those Standard Documents within 
	our GIT Source Repository. 
	
	This Document describes what is needed to be in a QTC Net Standard.
---
Format of a Standard:
	The Format of a Standard is a Human Readable Textfile that contains a YAML Like Syntax 
	called TYAML. It is YAML except that the indention is done by using Tabs. A TYAML2YAML 
	converter will be provided. With a Tabbed Indention as used in the rest of the project 
	you can configure your editors view to be comfortable for you.
	
	The Document consists of two sections (documents in YAML) the Head And the Body. This 
	Document will be used as an example for the upcoming Standards. 
	
Format of Header:
	The Header consists of the following Keys:
		- Title: The Title of this Standard
		- Author: The Authors of this Standard
		- QTC Standard Number: The Number this Standard has in the QTC-Net Repo
		- Version: Version of this Document YYYYMMDDnn where nn is a number between 00 and 99
		- License: GPLv3 is good, it should be open
		- Abstract: A short Abstract of this standard

Format of The Body: 
	The Body is a set of Topics with Text in it. Try to describe everything there, dont use to 
	long lines because this is version controlled Text.

Format of the Filename:
	nnn-TOPIC.txt
	The Format of the Filenme should Start with the QTC Standard Number up to 3 Digits as long 
	as we do not have more than 1000 standards. :)  Within the Topic all spaces should be excanged 
	with underscores (_).
