Abstract:
  To exchange messages in QTC Net, a flexible binary Format is needed, other formats 
  like xml or yaml contain to much redundant data, which is not good if you consider 
  using small bandwidth links.
  
  This Spec defines how the qtc net binary format is structured, it should help you 
  to build a parser for those messages.
