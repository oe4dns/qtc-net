Abstract:
	To exchange messages in QTC Net, a flexible binary Format is needed, other formats 
	like xml or yaml contain to much redundant data, which is not good if you consider 
	using small bandwidth links.
	
	This Spec defines how the qtc net binary format is structured, it should help you 
	to build a parser for those messages. 
---
Magic:
	Every QTC-Net Binary Messsage starts with a 3 byte magic, called magic. It will 
	help to identify the Data structure. This is also the place where Extensions can 
	be made, by simply defining another magic, for example for pictures or Logbook data. 

Flexible Size Interger Numbers:
	"Flexible Size Unsigned Integer Numbers" are called FUINT in this spec and all the 
	upcoming specs. This is an unsigned Integer whose Length in Byte depends on the Digits 
	needed to store the number. The Precision in Byte of the Number is defined by the 
	Number of leading zeros terminated by the first 1 at the beginning of the Number.
	
	Example: 
	    0b10000001 ==> one byte length number is 1
	    0b01001111 ==> two byte length number is 255
	    0b01010000 ==> two byte length number is 256
	    0b001100000000 ==> 0x030000 ==> 3 byte length number results in 65536
