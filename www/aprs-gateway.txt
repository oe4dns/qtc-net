The APRS Gateway trys to deliver messages from QTC-Net as soon as 
the calls are seen in APRS. 

On the other way round, it can pick up messages to any call as long 
as the sender also has a qtc-net operator message published. (this means 
he must have edited his aliases.) It will publisch those messages in qtc
net and send the ack back to the APRS App. The QTC-Net and its gates are 
now in full responsibility to deliver those messages, see last paragraph. 

As some candy, the delivery is now possible even when the sender 
already switched of his radio. 

--------------------------------------------------------------
to start up your own gateway: 

$ ./qtc_aprs.pl -d /var/spool/qtc/messages \
	-pd /var/spool/qtc/some_private_key_dir \
	 -p 1337 2>> /var/spool/qtc/aprs.log

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Calls: The qtc net calls are translated to aprs calls by exchanging 
// with - and the other way round.
