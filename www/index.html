<h1>QTC-Net</h1>
<h2>A Short Telegram System for Amateur Radio</h2>
<h2>ALPHA Version</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<p> QTC-Net is a decentralized telegram distribution system for amateur radio, it can be used to 
contact an operator without knowing his current location or radio equitment. It is designed 
to be decentralized and therefor faultproof, but it also trys to address security questions as 
long as this is important for public amateur radio messages.  </p>

This graphic trys to illustrate the network, it is somewhat ugly and too complicated, 
and will be exchanged soon, but we have really trouble to explain QTC Net in two 
scentences. <br>
The net is basically a decentralized drop off point for short telegrams from one operator 
to another operator. The Messages are all public as it is for Amateur Radio Service. The 
Transfer from one endpoint station to the Network or the other way round will mostly be 
done manually, by having a friendly operator (who may chease some delivery points for 
a diplome) in the middle who has access to the Network. 
<br>
The easiest way to access the network ist via Internet, but anyway the messages and 
Interserver communications are designed to be transmitted via Radio Links as well, 
if there is enough bandwidth.

<h3>Web Access URLs</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.qtc-net.org/">https://www.qtc-net.org/</a> runs a small webapp which is the easies way to get access. </p>
<p>If you have your own application, right now there is one linux commandline thingie in the Source code, or 
if you want to run your own message server you can access the http interface via 
http://www.qtc-net.org/qtc-if.cgi in your application, or message downloader.</p>

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions:</h3>
<a href="faq.html">The FAQ is here.</a>
<hr>
<h3>Development:</h3>
The Development will take place on <a href="https://github.com/zem/qtc-net.git">GIT-HUB</a>

<hr>
<h3>Development Status:</h3>
We don't made a release yet. This means the code is still changing a lot. 
<ul>
	<li>qsolog is an 'I would like to be an adif logger when I am grown up' program that we use to test message creation</li>
	<li>qtc::publish is a library and all you need to include to publish qtc messages</li>
	<li>qtc::query is a library and all you need to include if you want to query for a set of qtc messages</li>
	<li>qtc::processor is responsible for sorting all the messages into the filesytem structure</li>
</ul>
So far if you want to see the code: qtc::msg module is already pod documented. It would be good to have that on 
the rest of the code as well. So if you want to contribute just make a pull request on GIT-HUB. Or write a 
Feedback or Bugreport.

<h3>Protocol:</h3>
A Brief description of the Protocol <a href="protocol.txt">Protocol</a> this is derived from 
the heavily brainstormed <a href="qtc-net-draft.txt">draft</a> as well as <a href="qtc-net-draft-02.txt">draft-02</a> 
that contains every note we did, and every idea we hat. Not everything in those drafts was useful.
