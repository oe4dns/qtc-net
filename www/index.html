<h1>QTC-Net</h1>
<h2>A Short Telegram System for Amateur Radio</h2>
</center>
<hr>

<p>QTC Net is a decentralized telegram and microblog system for amateur radio. A user or ham system can check in 
a telegram from any sender to any receiver, as well as access those telegrams and mark them as delivered when 
they are delivered.</p>

<img src="QTC-Net.svg">

<p>The network itself basicly consists of signed messages that are spreaded between the network nodes. 
A message may contain a telegram as well as other information like the delivery notification 
(called qsp). The message format is designed to have a small sized footprint. It is also unencrypted 
therefore it is legal to transmit a message itself over a radio link.</p>

<p>There are gateways to DXCluster, APRS, RSS-Feed and WebPages available and many more links like DMR, 
PSKMail, PSK31, are planned.</p>

<h3>Web Access URLs</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.qtc-net.org/">https://www.qtc-net.org/</a> runs a small webapp which is the easies way to get access. </p>
<p>If you have your own application, right now there is one linux commandline thingie in the Source code, or 
if you want to run your own message server you can access the http interface via 
<b>http://www.qtc-net.org/qtc-if.cgi</b> in your application, or message downloader.</p>
<p>You may look for new messages via RSS Feed at <b>http://www.qtc-net.org/qtc-rss.cgi?call=oe1src&call=oe1gis</b> an 
optional type parameter can help you to specify what messages you are looking for</p>

<h3>Standards:</h3>
The first standard Documents, Those will help you to code your own implementation:<a href="standards/">Standards</a>
<h3>PERL Manpages:</h3>
A Brief description of the <a href="pod/">pod manpages</a> 
<h3>QuickInterface:</h3>
if you want to connect only App younameit without implementing the full protocol you may have a look at the  <a href="quick-interface.txt">qtc::WebApp's Quick XML Interface</a> 

<hr>
<h3>Development:</h3>
The Development will take place on <a href="https://github.com/zem/qtc-net.git">GIT-HUB</a>

<h3>Development Status:</h3>
An alpha version as preview is released. This means the code is still changing a lot. 
<ul>
	<li>qtc::publish is a library and all you need to include to publish qtc messages</li>
	<li>qtc::query is a library and all you need to include if you want to query for a set of qtc messages</li>
	<li>qtc::processor is responsible for sorting all the messages into the filesytem structure</li>
	<li>qtc::WebApp is an example web frontend</li>
	<li>qtc::interface::http implements an incremential download interface via HTTP</li>
	<li>We have an rss feed</li>
	<li>qtc::aprs::is implements an APRS gateway, please start your gateway</li>
</ul>
So far if you want to see the code: qtc::msg module is already pod documented. It would be good to have that on 
the rest of the code as well. So if you want to contribute just make a pull request on GIT-HUB. Or write a 
Feedback or Bugreport. All bugs are filed via GitHubs BTS, we are also using that list as a Tasklist so 
we do not forget anything.

or you may send a qtc net telegram to the <b>qtcnet</b> list within the net, by just 
addressing to qtcnet as a callsign. You can receive messages on that list by adding 
that list to your callsign (aliases and lists in the webfrontend).
