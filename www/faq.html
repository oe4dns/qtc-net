<h2>FAQ</h2>

<hr>
<h4>For which modulation is QTC-Net designed for?</h4>
All of them! Because the last hop is designed to be done Manually, there will be no restriction to 
hardware or software an operator may use, that means you can freely playing around. 

<h4>Who will Transmit the messages?</h4>
A friendly helpful operator who has access to the Networks backbone. That normally means 
an Internet connection. 

<h4>What are the Benefits for a Station?</h4>
Well apart from the Ham Spirit, and stuff you can transmit to the operator you like. 
We are thinking about some sort of Diplome for delivered messages. 

<h4>Why not Use APRS?</h4>
Well, the IGates do not store messages, that means messaging is useles except you 
know that the receiving station is alive right now. Oh and you need hardware which 
reduces the number of potential users to a minimum.<br>
But apart from that, using APRS as a transport for QTC-Net Telegrams is technical 
possible, and would fit together perfectly. So please choose this as your next 
project. 

<h4>There are Packet Radio Mailboxes doing similar things, why not use those?</h4>
You still need to know which is the right mailbox, the access to the mailboxes is difficult, 
especially if you are remote. User Counts are dropping. But the same rules than for APRS apply 
here as well. It is perfectly good to Transport QTC-Net Telegrams through Packet Radio. 


<h4>What about Winlink and PSK Mail?</h4>
30 Minutes until you have a connection if you are fast! You need to take a laptop with you. 
(that is not needed within QTC-Net).
