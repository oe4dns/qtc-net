<h4>What is QTC Net?</h4>
QTC Net is a decentralized microblogging (like twitter) and short telegram delivery especially 
designed for Ham Radio use. It is heavily inspired by other Projects like Bitcoin, Twister and 
Bitmessage. Anyone can setup a QTC Net Server and therefore extend the Network. The protocol 
designed not to be in conflict with laws if you want to syncronize two servers over a radio 
link.<br/>
QTC Net also is a collection of specifications and standards that together solve the tasks 
mentioned in the last paragraph. 

<h4>For which modulation is QTC-Net designed for?</h4>
All of them! Because the last hop is designed so that it can be done manually, there will be no 
restriction to hardware or software an operator may use, that means you can freely playing around.
It does not matter if you transport a message by APRS, or if you read QTC transmissions via a 
PSK31 or CW Skimmer and Publish them to QTC Net. <br/>
Each modulation connection will have it's own specification, that should be published. 

<h4>Who will Transmit the messages?</h4>
Even a friendly helpful operator who has access to the Networks backbone can deliver you a 
telegram. This right now means an Internet connection, we are working on HamNet. 
An APRS is already working. 

<h4>What are the Benefits for a Station?</h4>
Well apart from the Ham Spirit, and stuff you can transmit to the operator you like. 
We are thinking about some sort of Diplome for delivered messages. 

<h4>Why not Use APRS?</h4>
Well, the IGates do not store messages, that means messaging is useles except you 
know that the receiving station is alive right now. Oh and you need hardware which 
reduces the number of potential users to a minimum.<br>
But apart from that, using APRS as a transport for QTC-Net Telegrams is technical 
possible, and we have an APRS Gate right here in the Code. By using QTC Net, messages 
can be stored and transmitted as soon as the receiving station is on Air again. The Sending station 
can be swithed of as soon as the Network approves that is has received the Message. 

<h4>There are Packet Radio Mailboxes doing similar things, why not use those?</h4>
You still need to know which is the right mailbox, the access to the mailboxes is difficult, 
especially if you are remote. User Counts are dropping. But the same rules than for APRS apply 
here as well. It is perfectly good to Transport QTC-Net Telegrams through Packet Radio. However 
we do not have a spec for this yet. 

<h4>What about Winlink and PSK Mail?</h4>
We are planning to integrate QTC Net within PSKMail. So PSK Mail can serve as a client for 
QTC-Net, and extent the Network. 

<h4>Do I have to use Your server?</h4>
NO, every Server has the same Data and the Same privileges. If you decide to Integrate 
QTC Net for example to your Callbook, you can set up your own server, this also extends 
the Network.
