A short telegram system for Amateur Radio


This ugly graphic tries to illustrate the network, it is somewhat ugly and too complicated, 
and will be exchanged soon, but I have really trouble to explain QTC Net in two 
sentences.

The net is basically a decentralized drop-off point for short telegrams beint sentfrom one
operator to another operator. The messages are all public as it is for Amateur Radio Service.
The transfer from one endpoint station to the network itself or the other way round will mostly
be done manually; by having a friendly operator (who may chase some delivery points for 
a diploma) as a middleman who has access to the network. 

The easiest way to access the network ist via Internet, but anyway the messages and 
inter-server communications are designed to be transmitted via radio links as well, 
if there is enough bandwidth available.
