A short telegram sytem for Amateur Radio


This ugly graphic trys to illustrate the network, it is somewhat ugly and too complicated, 
and will be exchanged soon, but I have really trouble to explain QTC Net in two 
scentences.

The net is basically a decentralized drop off point for short telegrams from one operator 
to another operator. The Messages are all public as it is for Amateur Radio Service. The 
Transfer from one endpoint station to the Network or the other way round will mostly be 
done manually, by having a friendly operator (who may chease some delivery points for 
a diplome) in the middle who has access to the Network. 

The easiest way to access the network ist via Internet, but anyway the messages and 
Interserver communications are designed to be transmitted via Radio Links as well, 
if there is enough bandwidth.
